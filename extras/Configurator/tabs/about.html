        <strong>Phoenix Configurator</strong> was designed to <span style="color: green">improve</span> user experience by not requiring extensive programming knowledge<br />
        needed to do proper <span style="color: green">sensor calibration</span> and <strong>debugging</strong> of various flight control elements (kinematics, motor outputs, etc).<br />
        <br />
        This also allows users to do <strong>PID</strong> tuning right from the configurator (<span style="color: green">without</span> the need to reflash the flight controller afterwards).<br />
        Because all of the configuration changes are executed on the flight controllers side in <span style="color: green">real time.</span><br />
